I kept the ticket for a few years because I found it funny. I was flying from Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine. So the boarding pass just said PORTLAND PORTLAND.

The flight itself passed easily. I had spent the last two months fantasising about what we’d do “once we got out of here,” like inmates in the movies. Some talked about their girlfriends, some talked about cigarettes or drugs, but we all talked about food. We talked about ice cream, hamburgers, the meals our mom made us, stuff you’d expect. But late at night, staring out the blackness of the  Oregon desert, we’d come up with obscure stuff too.

“You know what I love to do at the movies? Using red vines as a straw.”
“What are red vines? Like Twizzlers?”  
“Nah, Twizzlers are nasty. Red vines for life.”  
“They both suck. It’s gotta be black liquorice.”  
“Gross! As a straw?”  
“No, not as a straight. Just by itself. Who uses a red vine as a straw?”  
“It’s so good.”

We had conversations like this about any food in American culture. Which nuts were best. What to buy at TCBY. Taco Bell tips. Black or green olives. Chunky versus smooth peanut butter. Types of jelly. Vegetables that actually taste good. Toppings on pizzas. And gorp. So much conversation about gorp, otherwise known as trail mix. Should gorp have raisins? What about bits of chocolate? Sunflower seeds? There were no gorp purists in our group. We’d have accepted literally anything in our gorp because we were so tired of our meagre options. We had assorted nuts and raisins for gorp, then rice and lentils for dinner. Maybe we had other stuff like ramen, or maybe meat sometimes. But I don’t think so. I’m pretty sure it was rice, lentils, nuts, and raisins for an entire summer. And now I was at Portland airport as an unaccompanied minor. And I could see a Cinnabon.

And not just that. I could also see McDonald’s, the home of many of my culinary fantasies over the last summer. It was the home of the hot apple pie, of strawberry milkshakes, of ice cream sundaes, of fries and Big Macs. In World War Two movies, some soldiers would talk about their beautiful girlfriend back home, and how much they missed her. McDonald’s was my food girlfriend. I had lusted after her for an entire summer, and now I had some money in my hand and some time to kill before my flight to the other Portland.
