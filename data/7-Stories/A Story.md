## A Story

He woke earlier than the rest of the dormitory, more a survival tactic than because he wanted to. But he had started appreciating the stillness in the morning on its own merits. Maybe after all this silliness was behind him, he could turn into a morning person? Stranger things had happened.

By waking up early, he could make sure to get to the showers before everyone else. He grinned to himself when the faucet squeaked, imagining Dylan getting woken up in his bunk through the wall. He turned the knob a few more times than he needed to in order to send a few more metallic squeaks through the pipes. Served him right, the fucker. For all he had done, it was the least he deserved. Brad lathered quickly across his body, used soap in his hair to help it stand up, and rinsed off all within about 60 seconds. Then he turned the faucet counter-clockwise again, then stopped about a half-twist from closed, which made the pipes shudder and squeal. That’d probably wake up the whole place.

Then a quick dry-down, perfunctory teethbrushing in a towel, then he shrugged on his shirt, tugged on his pants, fastened his belt, tucked his socks into his pockets so they wouldn’t get wet, and padded quickly down the hall to his room. He only needed to crack the door slightly to reach around and grab his boots, then he stood into them while pulling the heels. A quick lace-up and he was out the side door before anyone else even made it down the hall. Simple. The day was his.
