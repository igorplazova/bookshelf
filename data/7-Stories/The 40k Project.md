## The 40k Project

It started as a joke. A political pundit tweeted out stats from the 2020 election showing that 36,174 Democratic votes would have flipped the state and said “Time for the Lauren Powell Jobs Climate Refuge Project in Anchorage?”

A few months later, a simple website appeared, announcing something called The 40k Project. Its two paragraphs explained the idea — get 40,000 people to move to Alaska, powered by subsidies — and there was a simple Google Forms link on the bottom to sign up. It made quite a stir.

Debate erupted, of course. Could it be real? How much would the subsidies be for? Could Alaska support this many new voters? How long would you need to live there? Was it moral and ethical? Was there precedent? Would Alaska find a way to stymie the movement? Was there a timeline?

A few weeks later, the site announced that 100,000 leads had signed up and gave more details about next steps. It announced the backers behind the project, a network of political operatives who had worked on campaigns for Warren, Yang, Obama, Biden, and both Clintons. Rather than a single wealthy individual, the group was organised like a collective. One who knew how to fundraise, which they began immediately.

A month later, the list had grown to 350,000 overall, with about 80,000 confirmed as high quality leads. The group had also raised $17 million from a range of donors, enough to pay each traveler a paltry $400. Better than nothing, but not enough to make much of a difference. Worse, the vast majority of the people signing up were San Francisco tech types who could work remotely. There’s nothing inherently wrong with San Francisco tech types working remotely, but the lack of diversity was identified as a problem.

So the group established a new goal: cultural diversity and sustainability. Instead of shipping people up to Canada and giving them barely enough money for an Anchorage Costco run, why not try to build out an actual society with a range of backgrounds and skills? As long as they were all Democrats, of course. So instead of looking for people, they looked for the components that would build a society. Which is a lot harder than people and checks.

Despite their efforts over the course of a half year, the group was still about 50% tech workers, but that was still an improvement. But the group rounded out the diversity further. People of colour? 10%. Division between men and women? 50/50. Ages? Pretty close to the US national average. There were couples, singles, and families. There were some big families too. And they didn’t wait for formal permission. Many of them started moving up even without getting through the interview process, or being promised checks.

By New Years Day 2022, eleven months after the first tweet, there were 4829 new Alaskan citizens officially part of the 40k project totals, and several hundred more who made the move without officially being part of the project. Another ten thousand were in the process of moving. And most importantly, dozens of new businesses were getting formed all throughout the state.  There were hundreds of sole proprietorships, but Google set up and office, as did Twitter and some mid-tier companies. And not just in the big places like Anchorage and Fairbanks, but also in places like Homer and Cordova. Netgear even had a small office in Sitka, and they were hiring.

People outside of the tech sector weren’t able to move quite as easily, since it’s hard to operate a bakery or be plumber over Zoom. So a proposal was floated to re-structure the way the money was spent. By this point, the group had raised a massive $300 million, so instead of cutting a check for everyone who moved to Alaska, the decision was made to contribute the money to businesses and entrepreneurs only. A new business could get a grant for $100,000 just by filling out an application and explaining how their business would benefit Alaskan Democrats. It was a modern gold rush, with political activists around the country pitching in cash and courageous settlers swelling by the day.

By the summer of 2022, 21,098 people had officially joined onto the 40k project, about half of its eventual goal. But immigration statistics showed that a full 33,842 had moved into the state. The size of the difference was puzzling. And to Democratic strategists, concerning. Some percentage of the difference could be explained by people who believed in the mission and had moved alongside the main group. But it seemed a much larger percentage of the new Alaskans weren’t there as part of the project. They were there to make money off the project. And that could be anyone, but was probably more likely to be businessmen. Who are more likely to be Republicans.

All eyes were on Alaska that summer because of a few big events combining into a single big story. Lisa Murkowski, a popular Republican senator, was up for re-election. But rather than cruising to victory as she had many times before, she was going to have to campaign in an open primary, the first in Alaska’s history. That was made more complicated by the fact that Donald Trump was holding a grudge against her, and had encouraged a strong primary challenge. This was splitting the vote between the traditional Republicans and the Trump Republicans. Which should have given a big opening to the Democrats, if it were any other year.

But there was another factor at play. Alaska had moved to ranked-choice voting in 2020, which was sure to give an enormous boost to the independent candidates in the general election. The primary polling was bearing it out, too. Murkowski was essentially in a three-way tie against the Trump candidate and the Democrat. So it would come down to the ranked-choice enthusiasm. Would Trump-aligned voters write in Murkowski as their second choice, or would they rather go with the the independent?

Alaska, and the country at large, got a hint the day after the primary:

Traditional Republican (Murkowski): 28%
Traditional Democrat: 27%
Trump-supported Republican: 23%
Leftie independent Democrat: 12%

And this is where it all went wrong for the 40k project. The huge influx of New Alaskans were aligned with the Leftie indie Democrat, not the traditional one. No amount of begging and pleading from the centrists in the group could convince them. It was like the Biden/Sanders and Clinton/Sanders debates all over again. The centrists and the left just didn’t see eye to eye. That persisted all the way to election day.

In the end, Lisa Murkowski won. She got the third most 1st place votes, which doesn’t seem like the sort of position that should win an election. But she more than made up for it with second and third place votes. In the end, the Democratic vote ended up splintering far more than the Republican vote. Trump’s favoured candidate fell to third place despite a strong first ballot showing. The election gave both sides a lot to consider in terms of strategy. In the end, the incumbent advantage proved too much to overcome.

But the group remained. Some ended up moving back home. But many more joined the call to move to Alaska. Not just for Democratic politics, but for a new community of like-minded people. It turns out a lot of people doing something is a big draw in its own right. People like to belong to something larger. Even if they don’t end up with a winning electoral strategy.
