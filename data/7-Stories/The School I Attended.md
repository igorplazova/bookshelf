## The School I Attended

College was always a given. My brother and parents all got their degrees and my dad got a PhD. Everyone I knew was destined for colleges. And they all came from families full of college graduates. The kids in my neighbourhood mostly had doctors and lawyers as parents. It painted a pretty clear picture for me. Life went like this: You go to school, you get a good degree, and you make a lot of money. That’s how it goes.

But I also noticed the other side of that story. I noticed a lot of divorces, latchkey kids, and alcoholism. I saw that people around me seemed pretty miserable. Chatting with successful and interesting people is a lot of fun, even as a kid. But as time went on, I started to notice the subtle signs of people who were impressive but unhappy. I saw that outward success wasn’t always a strong indicator of a healthy inner life. And as I got older, it started to feel like success actually made people less happy. Could it really be true?

I went to a boarding school for off-track kids. They called the syllabus “character education” and I loved it. It was really hard, and a lot of people take issue with the techniques used by the school. But in my view, the difficulty and character focus of the school was exactly what most kids need. The school taught that the goal of life isn’t to make a lot of money, it’s to be true to yourself. They believed in honest, hard work, and not falling into the trap of living someone else’s life. Sounds pretty familiar to anyone talking about work/life balance in 2023, but in the early 90s, it was a pretty radical concept. And by then the school was already 30 years old! The school was truly ahead of its time.

The school had a bit of a mixed message when it came to higher education. On one hand, people with a college education do better than ones who don’t. So if you’re a guidance counsellor anywhere in the world, even at my alternative high school, you’re going to encourage kids to stay in school. On the other hand, my school didn’t buy into the whole “get good grades to get a good job and then you’ll be happy” storyline. They didn’t believe in college in service of making lots of money. They believed in finding the right college to live up to “your own unique potential.” Not everyone is destined to have a high-powered and high-paying job, and that’s ok. As long as you’re living life on your terms and being true to yourself.

So when it came time for me to make a college decision, son and brother of highly educated people from an affluent area, I chose to take a year off. I did apply to a few alternative-type liberal arts colleges, but my heart wasn’t in it. I don’t recall my exact state of mind, I just remember knowing that a gap year was right for me. I wanted to pay rent. I wanted to juggle several jobs. I wanted to see what the real world was like, so that’s exactly what I did. I drove out to California and struggled for a year. It was awesome.

One year later, I moved to Seattle and enrolled at The Art Institute of Seattle. It was the late 90s and I still believed that all colleges had to play by a certain set of rules. For-profit schools like DeVry and University of Phoenix hadn’t come onto the scene in a big way yet, so I figured schools had a few tiers, all of whom had my best interests at heart: Ivy League, Party School, and Trade School.

I had a good time at The Art Institute of Seattle. My teachers worked hard, I worked hard, and I gained skills that I needed to succeed. My main complaint was that tech was moving too quickly for any syllabus to keep up with. It was the late 90s, the dotcom boom was happening, and I remember thinking every single day that I was missing the wave stuck in school. In hindsight, I was actually right. The people who succeeded the most during those years aren’t the ones who waited for books to be written about the emerging tech. They were the ones diving in and trying to figure it out on the fly.

I dropped out to start a job at a hot startup at the time, RealNetworks. My first day was the first Monday after Y2K, January 3, 2000. My lack of a degree never held me back — or at least not in ways I could tangibly notice — and my career moved along at a good clip. About decade later, I was a senior designer at Microsoft and I was looking to give back to my alma mater, so I went back to The Art Institute of Seattle to be an instructor. And things had changed.

I hadn’t noticed, but Frontline had released a segment a year earlier on for-profit schools preying on recent army vets. The GI Bill provides army vets with money for college, so for-profit schools had aimed their marketing squarely at them and their strategy had worked. Enrolment went through the roof, but degree completion was less than 30%, less than half the numbers for traditional colleges and universities.

When I toured the school as an instructor, a lot of things seemed similar. The teachers still seemed committed, and the classes seemed familiar. But over the year I taught there, I noticed a pretty significant number of army vets. They weren’t better or worse than my other students, and didn’t seem at any higher risk of dropping out. But I did notice their numbers, and we had some good chats about it.

I taught there for a year before starting my own design education company. Now it’s been another ten years and wikipedia organises Art Institutes into two main sections:  

* Origins and growth (1921-2010)
* Scandal and decline (2011-present)

The downfall story is pretty simple. The Art Institutes promised students things in their sales pitches that were inappropriate and illegal, so the US government removed their accreditation. Many of the schools were sold off to a religious organisation, which brought them under even greater scrutiny. Now things are in complete disarray with layoffs, lawsuits, and closures. And I’m left sitting in New Zealand watching it all fall down. And it’s making me think about the different perspectives I can have on the situation. A student, an instructor, an educator for a competitor, and someone looking back at everything in hindsight.

But there’s another wrinkle in the story that gives me another perspective. From 2005 to 2008, I worked at a company that helped students find schools. The business was simple: do a search for “art schools in seattle,” see results, learn about the pros and cons of each school, and apply. The school is happy because they get a lead, and my company would be rewarded with a payment for the lead. The business model is called “lead generation” and it’s very popular.

The company had good morals and ethics. We weren’t there to steer people to “diploma factories,” as we called them. We were there to provide helpful information to help people make a good decision. The best possible design was to let people compare prices, degrees, and locations against each other, so that’s what we built. Just like buying a vacuum cleaner, comparison shopping requires lots of information compared apples to apples so you can make an informed decision.

Somewhere along the way, the schools we worked with told us that they didn’t want to share as much information as before. They didn’t want to share cost, they didn’t want us to allow people to filter based on accreditation, and they didn’t like the comparison tools. So we had to remove tools we had already built or shelve plans we had coming. After all, the students weren’t our customer. The schools were.

So I saw this shift happen from all angles. I worked at a company that was wrestled into providing less information for students. I was an instructor that taught at a for-profit school that ended up being shut down by the government. And years before that, I got a good education at the same school. I feel like I climbed a rickety ladder, made it where I was going, and the saw the ladder explode in flames.

But it’s not all bad. At least my school got shut down. At least Frontline published that documentary. At least more people understand this scam now. For every person that got burned, that’s a whole network of family and friends who know to watch out for it. Which makes it harder for the scam to go on.

I had one student who I loved chatting with, because he was so charming. He wasn’t a vet, but he fell into the same category of many others in my class. He was artistically-minded and hoped that getting a degree in the arts would help him do what he loved for a living. I always enjoyed his assignments because he brought a lot of his own life experience into his projects. And always with a lot of charm.

I bumped into him about five years later while waiting for a bus. At that point I was making more money than I ever had because I was working at a big fancy tech company. We had a warm reunion on the Seattle sidewalk and caught up. I asked where he was working, and he mentioned Nordstrom. I beamed.

Nordstrom famously is a great place to work. Their tech team does some really great stuff, and being on that team means that he had made it. Once you work there, you can prove to employers that you’re good enough to work at any of the tech companies. Even the big ones.
  
“That’s great!” I said. “So, working on Nordstrom.com, or…”
“No,” he said. “I work retail in the department store. But enough about me, what have you been up to, man?!”

I tried not to show my disappointment. But I’d be lying if I said I was surprised. Of course he ended up spending all that money on a tech degree only to end up working at a cash register. The system wasn’t set up to help him. I did everything I could. I treated him as a worthy human being, I taught him what I could over a semester of classes, and I wished him the best.
  
He never lost his smile. I can’t tell if that’s good or not.
