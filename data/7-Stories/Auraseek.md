The other day I was walking down my street doing my twice-daily walk with my dog. In the mornings, we turn right and head down into the ravine, then come back around from the other end and walk along the ledge. In the afternoons, we reverse it. Edge first — better to see the sunset — then down into the ravine and back around and up again. It’s been this way for three years, since we got the dog. It’s a routine I look forward to. I like boring. I like knowing what to expect.

I pass people on my walk. Mostly the same faces, doing the same routines. These are my neighbours. I don’t know most of them personally, but we know each other’s movements. There are subtle greetings, smiles and chin nods. But mostly we stick to ourselves. We’ve got podcasts and music to listen to. Audiobooks, meditation-while-walking apps, that sort of thing.

I first spotted her as a feeling, or a visual distortion. She wasn’t a neighbour or a stranger. She wasn’t a woman or even a human being. I felt her before I knew what I was seeing. I just saw a glow, as if a little piece of the sun had been tucked behind a mailbox, beside the recycling bins, illuminating everything around it. I couldn’t spot the source, but as I squinted in the direction of the light, walking closer to it, I felt a strange calm. Like the feeling of goosebumps on my arm, but calmer. Half the intensity, or less. But calming.

As I got closer still, and rounded the bend in the road, I first spotted her. It was a shape, probably a woman, and she was walking away from me. She was glowing, but it was less something that I could see, and more something that changed the shape and color of things around her. It was more of a feeling than something I could describe. If I had to paint the scene, I’d start with a normal street, then draw in a person, then somehow make her filled with the feeling of looking forward to the first concert of the summer. But I don’t know what acyrillics can recreate that.
