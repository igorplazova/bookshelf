It was meant to be an album of celebration. Of “we’re still alive, let’s party.” Of looking past the screaming red breaking news banners and finding a temporary religion sweaty and dancing in a warehouse with our friends. It was never meant to hurt anyone. It was never meant the way everyone took it.

I still have the texts from Travis. He spoke in memes, so it’s hard to directly transcribe. But if you piece together the car gif, the squirrel gif, the person being beaned in baseball gif, the factory of fireworks detonating, the footage of Russian soldiers being blown up, and a few dozen others, what he was trying to say was something pure. In Queen’s English, it might have read something like “Everyone is having a tough time, we need to make an experience that people will remember for the rest of their lives. Something joyful and magical. Are you in?” In emojis, he was probably saying vomit emoji, alert emoji, rainbow emoji, thumbs up emoji, heart emoji, and nine exclamation points. You get it.

We had a bunch of songs already written. Probably about a hundred, but most of them weren’t there yet. He came to the house and we talked about them sitting on the couch. Some of my best work has been done side-by-side with a friend, not looking the other person in the eye. You throw on some sort of game, whether it’s Madden or Mario Kart or some fighter, it doesn’t really matter. Then you beat the crap out of each other and talk through things. You end up with a blended conversation that can really make progress. Despite the tangents.

“Oh shit, where’d you find that”
“Top right”  
“Oh you’re fucking dead”  
“Come get it”  
“Yo so I think Through the Dark could work”
“Yeah… oh you fucker”  
“Yeah, you like that?”
“Ok here we go, here we go. But yeah, Through the Dark, but we gotta tighten up the first part.”
“No doubt, no doubt. And I think I’m going to stop trying with the trilogy. They’re fucked.”  
“Oh? Fuck, I blocked that.”
“Yeah, maybe an EP. We’ve gotta focus this one, AW YOU FUCKER!”

So it was a few weeks of that, and things started to take shape. Travis didn’t need to send anything, it was all on his Soundcloud anyway and I had heard most of it. But he sent along a zip and said “Ok it’s done. Check it out.” I spent the next thirty minutes trying to figure out how to get it onto my phone so I could listen while I went on a walk. What the fuck, Spotify.

From the first song I could tell it was good. It was going to need a little more production work, then we’d have to do the whole marketing, album cover, outreach, social bullshit on top of that. But I could tell it was good. I could tell we had something. It made me want to dance. It made me want to stop thinking. That meant something. I texted him back when it was done.
  
“Yeah” I said.
“Right?” he responded.

So that’s how it started. They say the first 90% is fun and the next 90% tries to kill you. Although the internet tells me the original phrase is a little different. So maybe I’m the only one that says it that way. And maybe that’s why I get strange looks. Or maybe that’s unrelated.
