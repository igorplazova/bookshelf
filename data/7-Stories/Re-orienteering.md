“Ugh, not again.”

She squinted and knew the morning was not going to... 

Before she could even finish her first thought, she let out a sigh and sunk into just letting herself feel. No logic, no plan, no rationalisation, just ugh. Just plumes of billowing despair emerging from somewhere deep in her, clouding everything she saw. Just ... ugh. She sighed and tensed her body. She let out a petulant little half groan. “Erwhhhhhhhhhh” she emitted with a pout. “ErwhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhAAAAAAAAA!”

She did not feel better. And she did not want to tackle this day. She shook her head to herself, hearing the pillow scratch under her head. “No,” she said out loud.

“Can you shut the fuck up, PLEASE?” she heard someone say, and it surprised her at first. Oh, right. Shit. The soldier’s new roommate, Jel, had been moved into the room last night. They had only gotten a quick chance to say hello, because Wes had already been asleep and Jel was content to dispatch a short wave and low hello before trying to store her duffel bag and backpack under her bunk. Now it was a few hours later and Wes was waking up Jel. Now they were even, she reckoned. “Sorry,” she said. “Gonna be a tough day.”

“Mrrrpgh” Jel responded, her back turned to Wes. “I’m on second shift,” she said. Her voice sounded alert. Probably a light sleeper. “Ok,” Wes said. I’ll try not to wake you. “Too late, but thanks,” came the reply.

Once ready, she walked down the long interior hallway, headed left to the connector bridge rather than right towards the mess hall. While waiting for her authorisation scan to complete, she felt that stupefying calm someone feels when their mind is truly disconnected. She wasn’t pondering or processing anything. She was a completely empty vessel with no thoughts, waiting for the beep that came five seconds later. She walked on, guided by instinct.

On the far side of the bridge, she again turned left down another long interior hallway, and as she drew closer she began to hear the familiar commotion of weekly launch day. First she’d check in with the referee by the door, “making eyes” as they called it, then she’d wait in one of the four lines to get assigned a ship for the assignment. Every ship was one of the same four models, but each had different wear and personality, so they tried to match pilots with equipment that suited their tendencies.

The line usually moved quickly. After all, the system knew who was standing in each line, so it was just a matter of marching forward, one by one, then climbing into the little pod transport vehicles, pulling the cockpit closed, then scooting forward one lurch at a time until finally they’d be plucked by a large arm that would place them into their ships and begin the launch process.

Throughout all of this, she found it hard to think of anything much. She felt guilty for a moment. Surely she was thinking something, somewhere deep in there? But she really wasn’t. She felt comatose and absent. It would take more effort to fill her mind with something than to just let her eyes dilate and wander in the absence. So she conserved her energy and stayed mentally limp while robots beeped and blurred around her. Then — and this had never happened to her before — she fell asleep. Which was not recommended.

When she awoke, she was out of control, spinning through space. She clenched her whole body against the pressure and force, willing herself not to black out. Things started to blur, she heard ringing get louder, and then nothing.

They saw her craft go up in a fireball from the deck of the command centre.
  
“Shit,” said Commander Deere.
“Who was that?” someone asked.
“Wes Moorehead, I believe.”
“Shit.”

The first turn is the easiest. The system is designed to automate as much as possible, but once the ships are shot through the launch slide, a human is required to take control in order to navigate and set the course of the mission while accounting for the space junk they see. But before that, spaceships careen into a turn that requires a human to align to precisely, a bit like a space bobsled.

Wes had somehow slept through the countdown and the various alarms around her, yet had been gripping the joystick tightly enough to register as confirmation to the automated process. So she appeared to be conscious and able when in reality she was out cold. So when she ship came into the launch chute, she didn’t adjust her steering alongside the launch, which sent her craft off kilter. Then, in an effort to reign in her spinning aircraft, she over-corrected and clipped the edge of the launch wall perimeter. Boom.

But she wasn’t dead. Not yet. Her left wing had sheared off and her cockpit was lost in a split-second of a fiery explosion, but she had managed to eject in the midst of her spin and now she found herself racing into the inky black expanse in her little escape pod. She saw the explosion far below her, getting smaller, and behind it the base.

And still her mind was blank.
