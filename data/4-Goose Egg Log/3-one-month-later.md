## One Month Later

I meant to track my research more closely, but a month passed with no updates! I am liking Goose more and more, and some interesting things have happened in the meantime.

I listened to the 2021-11-21 Colorado show several times and got familiar with more of the songs. It really is a fun show, and a great way to get into the band. Then I started listening to 2019-11-16 in Buffalo, NY, and there aren’t a lot of songs in common. A good second album for learning more about the band.

That’s when I discovered Shenanigans Nite Club, their studio album from 2021. One song on there is called So Ready and it became an immediate hit for me and my family. The video is wonderful, the song is wonderful, and even if someone only ever heard this one song, it’s a real winner. We listened to it over and over again, but then it dawned on me that So Ready and Slow Ready are the same song. Whaaaaa?

It turns out So Ready and Slow Ready are both played in concert pretty regularly. The lyrics and notes are the same, but So Ready is funky whereas Slow Ready is a dreamy synth song. Fascinating. Imagine if your favourite band’s big hit had a standard version and a totally different one, and were both good.
  
Smells Like Teen Spirit and Smells Like Slow Spirit
Freebird and Slowbird
Sultans of Swing and Sultans of Slow

It’s really intriguing. I saw one person say they had seen Goose four times and got “three slow readys and a so ready.” It’s especially cool because both versions have such different vibes. I wonder what song I’d catch if I saw them live?

Somewhere along the way, Goose came out with another studio album called Dripfield. It was gratifying to listen to it and recognise a lot of the songs since I had by then heard so many different concerts. It’s a wonderful album, and it seems to be getting good reviews. I noticed that Slow Ready was criticised for being the only misstep on the album. At first I was annoyed by that opinion, but the more I listen to it, the more I agree. It doesn’t work as well on the studio as it does in concert.

Speaking of concerts, I started “going on tour” with Goose by visiting their Soundcloud page and listening to the concert the next day. It was pretty fun feeling like I was part of the tour in nearly real-time. And as I followed them around, an absolutely legendary thing happened. Trey, from Phish, joined them on stage. Worlds colliding!

My favourite part of the performance, which I’ve listened to several times since, is that Trey doesn’t show up and try to take over. He does a really respectful job playing *with* Goose instead of just showboating. It’s pretty sweet of him. The whole show is great, and then the addition of Trey (and Father John Misty) just makes it better. Super wonderful to follow along with.

Following this band is fun!
