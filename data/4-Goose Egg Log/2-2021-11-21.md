Goose has an official live album called “2021.11.21 Denver, CO” that I’m going to listen to now. If I end up liking Goose, it’ll be fun to go back to these first impressions at some point in the future.

#### Song one: Earthling or Alien?
Straight away I notice the guitar riff and the bass groove. They sound nice together. It’s a laid back song. But it’s 15 minutes! I wonder how they’ll pivot between the standard bits, solos, and jams.

There’s a long solo in the beginning, which is my first exposure to how well they play their instruments. Sounds good. And a bit later I hear the synth take the lead, which is notable and fun. Halfway through the song, just after the synth solo, the song stops. Huh!

And now they’re back at it with their very mellow and easy to digest riff. 

But they just stopped again.
  
And now they’re back at it again. So I suspect they’re going to close out the song with a jam. Oh, audience participation with clapping. And here we go, a chance to see how they shine as improvisers. One person calls out to another person and asks them to take a solo, which must mean that’s not usually how it’s done. A fun way to start a concert. Feels loose and free.

(Many minutes later)

Ok, that jam had a pretty fun peak. And then they land the plane. Well done, Goose. Nice and smooth. (I hear something that sounds like booing in the audience, but I assume it’s people screaming “Goooooooose” or something?)

#### Song two: Echo of a Rose
Another super mellow song. It feels a little like Sublime, reggae, or Jack Johnson. I particularly like the wan-wah that one of the guitars is playing around with. And is this a different singer?

(Many minutes later)

I’m really enjoying this solo/jam. Not sure how much is improvised and how much is standard. But I’m enjoying the wailing guitar and the chord progressions. Gives me the same feeling of Turn the Page or Black in that there’s a very emotional peak. I like emotional peaks like these. It feels bittersweet and poignant. 

I’m going to look this song up later to see if it’s a fan favourite.

### Song three: All I Need
This song just started and I like it fine. But apparently it’s going to be a 19 minute long one. Will be interesting to see where they go with all that time.

I’m liking the keyboards at the beginning of this song.

And at about 9:30 I’m quite enjoying the groove they’ve found themselves in. As usual, I don’t know if this is an improved section or if it’s part of how the song always works. But either way, it’s moody and I enjoy it.

Oh, at about 12 minutes things are getting spooky and dramatic. They even did a little wind chime effect twice, which helps the jam go subterranean. That’s a fun dynamic shift.

I’m really enjoying the outro. It’s reminding me of a song I love, but I can’t put my finger on exactly which one it is. I might be thinking of the end of Sir Psycho Sexy, by the Red Hot Chilli Peppers? Gosh, I think I am. Huh!
