## Getting things rolling

So this is my third post on my new bookshelf project. What I’d like to do is see if I can follow this flow:  

1. Write something in my writing app, Ulyssess
2. Press a magic button to have everything post online

So here we go! I am doing #1 right now and now we’ll see if I can make #2 work.

(Many hours pass)  
  
Hurray! It was hard and a lot of things broke, but I did it! Everything works so I can write a thing, press a command, and everything magically works! Feeling really good about that :)  

Next up: I have a lot of tweaks I want to make in the code. Like permalink. Those would be super nice.
