I am thinking about The Barefoot Investor. So here’s where I’m jotting down my thoughts about everything.

First things first, fuck American Express. I’m never applying with them again. It’s all bullshit.

Airpoints are bullshit. If I spend $30,000 at the grocery store, I get $352 in Airpoints dollars. I tried to book a flight and I was only allowed to use $18 of them in upgrades. That’s dumb. And then I went to the airpoints store and it was filled with garbage. Fuck airpoints. My life is too important to do all these dumb schemes.

So then I went to look into other credit cards. Maybe I could find one that’s not as dumb as American Express? Yeah, maybe. Except the form said it would take 20-30 minutes. That’s fucking dumb. I don’t need a card. Fuck you.

I think all I need to do is move $5000 into my Kiwibank card. That’ll be a nice little fund I can rely on if necessary. Then I just keep up my standard rate of saving, and I can move every dollar I save directly into passive investments because this crazy country doesn’t have capital gains. It’s nuts. Why have a separate fund for short term savings goals when I can just move things in and out of investments without any penalty?

Soon I’ll have paid off my taxes for 2021. This was the bill I was scared of and it wasn’t even that bad. I also just realised we have about $7k in USD squirreled away in PayPal, so that’s good to be aware of for US-centric costs.

I think this means I’m going to stick with ANZ over the short term. That’s a little frustrating, but at least I’m making improvements. At least the next time they block my card, I’ll have other options available to me. That reminds me, I should set up my cards on Apple Pay so even if I only have an Apple Watch I can still pay for stuff when ANZ does another dumb.
