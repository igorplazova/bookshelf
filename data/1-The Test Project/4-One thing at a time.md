## One thing at a time

This website is like everything. I had a goal, I reached that goal, and rather than feeling proud, all I can see is the next thing. I’d be like walking up a mountain, thinking “all I need to do is make it to base camp” but then when you reach base camp all you can think about is the summit. We’re not tuned to celebrate our short term wins. Which is good, in the sense that we always strive for more. But it’s bad because we never let success really sink in.

You know what’s funny about the summit in this metaphor? It’s easy to think “well, base camp isn’t the whole reward, so of course you’re eyeing the summit.” But no. When you make the summit, your brain will immediately think of the next summit. Do 10 summits and it’s thinking of the next 10. It’s not where you were, or where you are. The eyes are always on the horizon. That’s how we’re wired.
