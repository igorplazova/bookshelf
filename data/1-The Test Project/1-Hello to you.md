## Hello to you

I finally got my three pane experience working. I’m about to set it up, and I want to be able to put some sort of content into it. You know who’s probably going to see it? William and Sherry. Hi, William and Sherry!
  
But the counter-intuitive thing about writing for an audience is that it’s really important not to write for the audience. The most authentic thing is banging out a song in your bedroom for yoruself and then taking that recording and sharing it with others. Too many big artists start writing *imagining* the audience, in a giant stadium, with worldwide acclaim, and no. That’s not how to get there.

Imagine whispering to yourself under your blankets at night. “Hey me, you’re having a tough time, but it’s ok.” Imagine how authentic that is. Ok, now imagine what you’d say into a microphone in front of an entire stadium. Not only would you not say the literal same words, you wouldn’t dare be that authentic and real. No one whispers into a microphone “Hey, the world can be really tough but we’re always doing our best. Be safe out there.” No. We say things like “WOOOOOOOOOOOOO GO SEAHAWKS!!!” Or “YEAHHHHHHH!!!”  
  
I don’t relate to art that’s the equivalent of yelling into a microphone. I relate to art that has something to say. And that stuff is closer to the heart. Meaning it’s quieter and closer to one person’s experience. Which means it needs to be done in a separate space, away from the glare. I need to know what I think, but I’m doing it for me. Not you.

No offence, of course!   
  
But I know what I’m doing. I know what works. And this is what works. So it’s going to be fun to share this out as a way of saying “Hi, this is public” but also “But I need to not care that you’re here.” Hi! But also bye!

Ok, let’s post this live and see how it looks.
