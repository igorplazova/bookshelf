## Journaling, June 7 2022

First I just want to point out that journaling like this isn’t particularly interesting, but it does help me get my thoughts in order. So that’s fine.

I can imagine some robo-child after my robo-funeral looking through my old files and coming across this. They might find it somewhat interesting, especially now that I’ve talked about the robo-future in such a clear way. But the thing about the Information Age, as we we used to call it, is that there’s just too much information now.

Within a generation or two, we’ve gone from only having a few scraps of information about grandpa (if that) to having way too much information. I have a terrabyte of stuff people could sort through. But it’s mostly boring and hard to process.

We have to understand that people barely have enough time to eat lunch, let alone process all the worldly possessions of people who have died. If my grandpa died today (and that day is coming, he turns 100 soon!) and I suddenly had access to all his paperwork and items, then what? Maybe I sort through it, feeling nostalgic for an afternoon, and then I’ll move on to other things.

I am reading a book called Secondhand right now, and it’s got me thinking of all the stuff I’m surrounded by. It’s a lot less than we had in Seattle, but there’s still a lot. I dream of giving it all away. Not all of it, but … a lot of it. I want to drive carfulls of rubbish to the tip. I want to do it every weekend.  We used to call it a “house poop,” because just like a human being needs to export waste, a house has the same need. But houses don’t really export enough. It’s something to work at.

A few weeks ago I set a goal to write a ton of new things. I called the project My Next Million and I set up a goal so I could see how I was trending. But then a bunch of things went wrong with iCloud my backups, so I lost the habit. So it’s hard to get back into it. And when I do start writing, I always get frustrated when the only thing I want to write about is journaling like this. But it’s all normal. It’s all part of clearing out my headspace to do real work.

I need to do some audio recordings for Plebe 13. I did all the writing, now I just need to narrate. Once I narrate, I’ll be done. Which is going to be pretty great.

One thing that’s on my mind is thinking about money things. Not in the oppressive “ugh I need to think about retirement” way but more positive than that. I need to figure out how much money I want to make, how much I want to spend, and the decisions I’ll need to make in order to make everything happen. That’s a lot of fun for me to think through.
