Ok! I shipped Near Future Field Notes. I also made a wonderful nightly script to track how many words I’m writing every day. That’s going to go a long way to keeping me motivated, and has already borne fruit.

That said, I have Covid. I got it about a week ago and I’m feeling pretty much over it by now. But it’s been a tough few weeks of feeling cabin fevery and low.
