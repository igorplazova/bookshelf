“Can you be my girlfriend?”

I remember exactly where I was. I remember exactly how I felt. But I don’t know how I muddled through. I don’t know how it came to this. I just know it started with this insane question. This needy, entitled, thirsty, intriguing, and flattering prompt. One I had never heard before. One I knew straight away I’d fall for, even though I knew I shouldn’t.

The requests don’t just fly in randomly in some app that helps demons and human beings get matched. That would be a lot easier. Want money and power but don’t want to lose your soul? Swipe right. Or left. Whichever is the one where you’re saying no thank you. There are a lot of people trying to reach out to demons, but not enough public outreach to explain how it all works. Let me tell you how it works to save us all a lot of time.

Yes, demons can harvest souls. And yes, demons can give you special powers. This sets up a great marketplace. I have power and need a soul. You have a soul and need power. Easy, right? Well, no. There are a bunch of other details that don’t get the same attention, and that’s where things get crazy. First, some souls are better than others. There are low-rent souls and high-end souls, and most demons aren’t desperate enough to waste time on the weak stuff.

Think about it, there are seven billion people in the world. At any given time, I’d say about five billion of them are having a tough time. Of those five billion, about 20% might be ready to sell their soul, so that works out to one billion. That’s a lot. Imagine getting one hundred million texts a day, mostly from people you don’t want to talk to. That’s what being a demon is like.

It turns out there’s a trick to it, though. Demons learn pretty quickly to tune out the lesser-strength souls. And they’re all pretty much trash. So I only get about ten soul requests a day, and most of them aren’t really worth it. People ask for too much, for starters. I’m powerful, but I can’t do anything with a snap of my fingers. It takes effort, and most souls aren’t worth it. Would you work all day for one dollar? Yeah, it’s like that.
  
But sometimes someone’s soul is good enough for me to notice, and sometimes their request is doable. And that’s how this request got through. Be someone’s girlfriend? That’s easy. And the soul? Oh, damn. He had the best soul I had ever felt. I could feel it right off the bat. Not only could he be my boyfriend in exchange for my hand, I didn’t even want to eat his soul. I wanted to get to know him. I wanted to see where things would lead.

And it turns out love is hard. 

> My job as a demon is to take requests from those who summon me in return for their souls. It's amazing! But it's always the same requests. That's why I promised myself I wouldn't eat the soul of the one to give me a brand new request. Nothing new. Until today. "Can you be my girlfriend?"
