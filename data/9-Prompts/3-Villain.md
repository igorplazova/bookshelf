The last five minutes of my life was so dang awesome that I really need to document it before I forget. Most people beeline straight to the parties, the fun, the natural awe and wonder of the afterlife. After all, most of us that make it up here are ok with our life and death because our choices brought us here. You don’t see a lot of crying in the corner and wondering what happened. It’s more like “heck yeah, I win!” followed by “ok where the ladies at?” kind of vibe. It’s a victory lap, not limbo.

But while most people are content to look forward and enjoy their time up here, I’m frankly pretty dang pleased with myself and want to explain why. I’m not feeling particularly reflective, and I’m going to assume I’ll feel even less reflective over time. So this is meant to get the memories down while they’re still fresh. Ok, ok. Enough foreplay. Let’s get this documented for posterity.

So the first thing to understand is that people on earth would call me a quote-unquote villain. Fought the quote-unquote heroes, caused giant societal upheaval, yada yada yada, you get the idea. I’m a bad guy. Duh.

The second thing to understand is how someone like me made his way to the land of milk and honey after a lifetime of villainy. And that’s what my last five minutes were about. But I can already tell I’m losing interest in this story — wow, Heaven Syndrome really is real — so I won’t bury the lede. Here we go:
On my way out, I resurrected the hero’s best friends with a magic spell I had learned for that very occasion. And why did I do it? Because I’m all lovey-dovey for the hero? Heck no. Because I thought they deserved to live? Uh, no. The reason is more simple. I did it as a trick to come to heaven. That’s all. And it flippin’ worked. I can’t believe it worked. This is awesome.

So here’s the next part of the plan: one day the hero will die. And, gag me with a spoon, he’s going to come up here.  And that’s where I’m going to explain how his friends really died the first time. Right before I kill him for good.
  
So that’ll be fun.

Now: where the ladies at?

“A villain, in his dying breath as he's mortally wounded by the hero, uses the last of his magic in order to resurrect the fallen friends of the hero in his journey to defeat him. It sounds like a counterintuitive idea; Until you realize that some of them died at the hands of their allies.”
