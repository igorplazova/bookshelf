“It’s fine,” I said as I rummaged through the odds and ends in the office drawer. There was usually some Advil in here.
  
“It’s not fine,” someone said, probably Cathy. “Yeah, they really did a number on you,” said someone. I found the Advil and started working on the lid. Child-proof, my ass. “We need to figure this out, things are getting really bad out there,” Cathy said. “And the cops are useless,” said Desmond with a frown.

“Listen, all of you, I appreciate what you’re saying. But it was nothing. It was some random thing. I just want to move on. Crime in Seattle has been getting worse for years, and it was my time this time around. So-“  
  
They didn’t let me finish. “You think it was random?” Tabitha cried. “There’s no way.” My friends sure had a strange way of being there by isolating and disagreeing with me. Soon there were enough shouts and cross-talk that I lost track of the conversation. I just let them go while I checked my phone. Ugh. Texts from friends asking what was wrong. It was nice of them, but … ugh.

I put my phone back in my pocket, notifications unread. “Listen,” I said. “I’m going to talk a walk.” The group stopped arguing long enough to stop and stare. “Like hell you are,” said Anthony. It was kind of funny coming from him, a half-demon from Bellevue. But no one saw the humour. They never did.
