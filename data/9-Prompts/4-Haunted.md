Sometimes you need to scorch everything to the ground and start over. I get it. I lost all my friends in middle school. I was kicked out of high school. I dropped out of community college. I’ve rage quit, severed ties, refused to talk to my dad for years at a time, and been unafraid to walk away from anything when it was time. But this time might be different. I think I made a huge mistake.

I work at an NFT startup. I know, I know. But back then, it wasn’t as bro-oriented. When I started, it was mostly friendly nerds excited by how technology could empower normal people. I remember being as excited by the work as I was when I first learned about email in the early 90s. It felt like early Banksy, or the first time I heard Nirvana. The concepts felt way more interesting than what was happening in the mainstream. My gut is pretty simple: is it disruptive and strange? Great, sign me up. I can’t explain where or why I got this way, but I’ll always have an interest in the outsider. 

And that’s how I ended up at a NFT startup early on, before it was a trend. Problem was, I was hired as an engineer and I hadn’t written production-quality code in about twenty years. I thought I could shake the rust off and be a productive member of the team within a few months, but the learning curve was much more intense than I had bargained for. Fortunately the rest of the team treated me well and wanted to see me succeed. I spent hours a day on calls with my young coworkers and their nose piercings as they gamely tried to help me find my bearings.

I saw a lot of my younger self in them, just maybe without so many face tattoos. I doubted they saw their future in me, though. Middle-aged, married, balding, with a paunch and a mortgage. From hotshot to underdog in a few short years. They’d be there one day, even if they didn’t know it yet. I wondered if they’d handle aging with as much kindness as they showed while answering my dumb questions, or if they’d feel as adrift and useless as I often did. I wondered if it’d make them bitter and self-conscious as it had made me. Like a stranger in a strange land. Like a desperate immigrant fleeing Middle Management Cluster to try and succeed on Planet Cool Hipster Engineer Bro.

Before this job, I thought of myself as a pretty positive person. I used to believe in failing fast, iterating, pivoting, all of that. I don’t think failure has to be bad, I think when you find something that doesn't work, you're a step closer to what does work. And being an underdog can be fun at first, because you’re challenging yourself to prove the odds wrong. But as time goes on without success or progress, it becomes harder and harder to mentally show up. You start to wonder if maybe the odds were right. And that’s a dangerous place to find yourself. I could only handle being a bumbling idiot for so long before my ego sounded the alarm, and it only got louder over time.  So I finally quit last week. I couldn’t take it anymore.

I was surprised by how much they fought to keep me. They heard my concerns, they discussed a raise and a bonus. They talked about the intangibles I bring to the team. My closest friends on the team gave me pep talks and encouraged me to keep going. “You’re actually improving a lot!” they said. But all I could think was “you shouldn’t have had to qualify that with an ‘actually’.” It was time. I had to move on. Burn it down and figure out what new beautiful bird I can be next. That was the plan, like I had done many times before.

That was a month ago, and I’m realising it was a giant mistake. What is it in my wiring, or our wiring as a species, that drives us to self destruct? Why do we always think the grass is greener on the other side? Why do we cheat? Why do we give up? Why are we driven by ego? Why can’t we understand that this time — not last year, not next year, but this exact time we’re living through — is the best time of our life? Why do I dive into new adventures then abandon them just as quickly? Why do people make decisions that are obviously bad for them, driven by bias and ego rather than logic and intelligence? 

I don’t know why I left. I don’t know what I’ll do next. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, with us. I am haunted by humans.
