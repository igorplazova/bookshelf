## Journaling: 24 June 2022

I have 7 minutes until my next call. What’s been going on lately?

**Factorio**
I did a second run-through of Factorio. My previous score was 233 hours, and this one was about 83. Much better! That feels good.
  
I’m torn about next steps. It would be fun to do an entirely new game, because designing new things is fun. Or I could upgrade my current factory by tearing everything down and trying to rebuild it better. That sounds even cooler. Or a third option is to stop playing again to focus on other stuff. Also an option.

**Lots of books**
I got another massive stack of books from the library a few days ago. I’m enjoying them quite a bit. It’s good for my brain to read things. I should read things more. The more long-form the more it settles my brain.

**Getting away from journaling**
Lately when I open a new document in Ulysses I go straight to writing like this. Nothing wrong with writing things like this, of course. But I’d like to get back to creative writing. Just kicking off a story, no matter what the topic, is good. I enjoy doing it. I should do it more. Although I am doing comics, so that’s a thing. I should do that too/instead.

**Comics**
I have a comic concept I’m pretty excited about. I did the first little chunk of it, and now I want to figure out what to do next. I think the right approach is to start a new story. It can tie back to the first one, but it doesn’t necessarily need to tie in in a direct/obvious way.
