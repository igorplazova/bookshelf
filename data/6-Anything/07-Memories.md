## Catalouging Memories

The first memory that I can remember is standing on my driveway while a neighbour spoke to me. I moved when I was about five, so that be my only memory from living in Concord.

I have another memory that I’ve been told must have been a dream. I was very young, and I was playing in bed with my parents. Back when they were happy and together. I romanticise the idea that I have this memory embedded from when I was one year old. But the boring explanation — that it was a dream — is much more likely.

When we moved into our new house in Bethesda, there was a stereo in the kitchen while we cleaned. I put my ear up to it right as a song was starting. An electric shock bit me, which made me cry. My brother said I should have known the song was starting, but I wasn’t responding to the sound, I was hurt by the electric jolt.

I remember starting preschool at a church, and when I showed up the counsellors joked that they were onto me and my shenanigans. But I didn’t know it was a joke at the time. Was I a bad kid?

I sometimes took a cab home from the preschool. The drive couldn’t be more than a few miles. River Road to Wilson Lane, then Springer, then Thoreau. Four turns, about a mile away. One night we ended up on Rockville Pike, over ten miles away. The cab driver kept asking my address and I kept repeating it. Eventually we got home. My dad was on the couch watching a primetime broadcast of Taxi. I just realised how fitting that is.

We had a French exchange student for one year named Sophie. She was in high school and I was about 6. She was very kind to me and loved The Police. I think of her as my sister. She had some other French friends and once they took me to the pool with them.

Halley’s Comet was in 1986, when I was 7. My dad flew us down to Mexico so we could see it. He woke me up at 3am so we could spot it in a telescope. It looked like a big thumb smudge. I went to sleep on the sand while my dad fussed around with the telescope more.

My dad put together a presentation at my school about Halley’s Comet. I remember the other kids smirking and teasing me because of how energetic and excited my dad was talking about science. But I remember the look of pure admiration and envy from my teachers. The look told me I had an amazing dad, and they were right.

Around that time I started playing soccer, and my dad was the coach of my team. At the end of the season, he gave everyone little folded gray cards with dark brown calligraphy describing what thing each kid excelled at that season. I think mine was “swarm of bees defense.” 

I was watching a Saturday morning tv show. One of the scenes had lava flowing by while two robots discussed something. I was called into the kitchen and my dad told my mom “I don’t know what to say.” She said “just say it,” and he told me he wasn’t going to live at home anymore. I remember hot tears. I tried to squeeze them away and my throat ached. I tried to be strong for my dad. We looked for a place that day, from what I remember. Maybe it was later.

I rode my bike a lot through the woods. I played with my friends. I read books and drew. I walked around and thought about things. I had a good life.
