## 9-Two Singers

I’m watching a documentary on Alanis Morresette, and they’re talking about the way her first single detonated. And it reminded me of Nirvana’s first single. And in the interest of putting the thesis and premise right up front, I’ll just say that Alanis may have had a bigger impact on songwriting in the 90s than Kurt. That’s a tall order, but hear me out.

You Outta Know hits you in the face. As the story goes, the coolest radio station in LA got their hands on it, and after a single listen they ran down the hall to the DJ and had him put it on air immediately, interrupting his set. And then after the first play, the switchboard lit up. Everyone wanted to know who did it. The impact was immediate and caused a tidal wave across the cultural landscape.

Hearing that story and thinking back to my first experience (it made my jaw drop, like almost everyone else at the time) reminded me of Smells Like Teen Spirit. My personal experience with the song was similar to many kids in 1991. I was with a group at a friend’s house and someone played that legendary first track. We couldn’t believe what we were hearing, and we all wanted to know who did it. Within days or weeks, we all had the CD. And of course it blanketed the airwaves on MTV, although I wasn’t watching a lot of MTV at the time.

In the years since Kurt died, the fanbase has gotten a reputation for being overly invested and intense. So I have some trepidation announcing that I am a huge Nirvana fan. I don’t have a shrine to Kurt or anything, but I’ve put in some hours studying the lyrics and music. And take it from someone who knows Kurt the way some people track John Lennon — Kurt wasn’t much of a lyricist. He could when he wanted to be, but he mostly didn’t want to be. The lyrics were meant as mouth sounds to go along with the music. The music always came first, and the words only meant to serve it.

There are a lot of inside jokes about lyrics being unimportant on the Nevermind album. There are a lot in there, and a lot has been written about Kurt’s writing process. But probably the most succinct and spot-on reflection of his mindset is the lyric “one more special message to go, then I’m done and I can go home.” I mean, there it is, folks. 

And then there’s Alanis. Every single line is coming straight from her heart, and targeted at a person. It starts simple:

I want you to know  
That I’m happy for you

And famously escalates from there. It’s a primal, intense, relatable explosion of emotion from someone who has something to say and the means with which to say it. The entire album is known for direct, confessional, and emotional output, whereas Nirvana’s instant classic is known more for opaque lyrics like:

Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach  
As I want you to be

Which isn’t to say Kurt’s lyrics aren’t powerful, or to claim that the album isn’t solid. Most people agree that it’s some of the best songwriting of the decade, and massively influential. But so was Jagged Little Pill, who managed to cause the same cultural tsunami without hiding behind the meanings of her lyrics. Alanis wanted you to see her for who she was, and she succeeded. And in the process, she was more relatable and perhaps even more inspirational than the mighty Nirvana.
