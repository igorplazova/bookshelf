## You Just Have to Look

A phrase came to me a moment ago: “you just have to look.” It sounds easy, right? Isn’t looking the easiest thing in the world to do? It isn’t. And that’s where most people go wrong. Or maybe I’m just speaking for me.

This is paired with another insight I’ve been thinking about for the last year or two, which goes like this: “nuance is a luxury.” It’s easy to understand good guys and bad guys. It’s difficult to see everyone as standard human people with differing goals that can sometimes cause conflict. It’s easy to come to a snap judgement, make broad generalisations, or have a coarse understanding of a topic. Snap, broad, coarse. But all the best learning is the reverse. It’s slow, deep, and detailed. So where does that leave us?

* You just have to look
* Nuance is a luxury

On the surface, it feels like society is doing a lot of looking. We scroll things like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and Twitter. We’re — pick your metaphor — buried, saturated, drowned, overwhelmed, snowed in by other people’s ideas. We see thousands of advertisements, opinions, and insights. Isn’t that looking? I don’t think so. Because looking should be active. Reflexively tapping an icon that whisks you into an algorithmic timeline is not active. It’s numbing. It’s a surrender that leaves us feeling revved up, ready to fight, but also that the enormity of the task is too great. That any fight is hopeless and doomed to fail.

On a more positive note, humanity has built the internet, a sprawling playground for explorers and adventurers. “Sprawling” doesn’t come close to explaining it. It’d be like describing the number of grains of sand on earth as “a lot.” And the word “internet” has been used so often it’s been bleached of all meaning. You guys, it’s a NETWORK of NETWORKS. Remember when that felt exciting? I do. Because it’s how I felt this morning. “Wait, in 2022? How quaint.”

In the 80s, I remember hearing the old rockers bemoan music. “Rock is dead,” they’d sneer. I thought maybe they were right. I guess I missed out! I guess the 80s has no redeeming value culturally! Oh well, I guess we should all eat worms and die. I prepared for the end of human civilisation and the arts, since I had clearly missed the heyday represented by the 70s.

But wait, everyone said the same thing in the 90s! Now rock was dead, but so was punk and rap. Ditto country. Everything was dead. Things were better in the 80s, when things really mattered. When there was still an underground. When art and culture actually *meant* something. But this time the complaints didn’t resonate as much. I studied the stringy-haired gas station attendant wearing The Ramones shirt and ranting about Nirvana, and realised he was the same archetype I had seen with a Led Zeppelin shirt ranting about Talking Heads all those years ago. Huh.

I saw the same angry culture warrior making the same complaints years later, but this time he was wearing the outfit from my generation. It was a “9 out of 10 kids choose crayons over guns” shirt, the way 14 year olds like me used to wear in the 90s. But he was still at the gas station. He was still positive that culture used to be better. He still had stringy hair. But now he was in his late 30s. And I saw myself in him. And I wondered how I could avoid turning into him. It became a background process in my mind for the next few decades.

A few years later, I spoke to my friend’s parents. I had looked up to them as parental role models since I was 18. I always thought if I became a dad I’d want to channel their style of parenting. So during one visit, I asked if they had any advice about aging gracefully. It turns out they did.

> “I’ve found the key is to keep saying yes. Like if someone asks if I want to see a Bob Dylan show, of course I do. But if someone tells me about Kendrick Lamar, there’s more of a temptation to say no. So I just try to force myself to say yes. I won’t know the songs, and it might not be my cup of tea. But the act of saying yes, in itself, is the victory. And who knows, I might just find a new source of joy in my life. But that’s not the point. The point is staying open to the possibility. That’s how I stay young.

That is someone who is looking, not merely seeing. Or worse, allowing an avalanche of pre-qualified and time-tested preferences and opinions to snow them in. It takes effort. It takes time. It takes a willingness to leave the warm confines of your mental house and go brave the elements to see what you can find. It doesn’t always feel fruitful, and it’s always a struggle. But struggle is good. Do we forget that as we age?

In the last few days, I’ve discovered a bunch of new exciting things on the internet. There are literally millions of different communities and subcultures burbling along, right now, and you’re welcome to join in. The internet of the 90s sucked, both objectively and subjectively. So I can’t stand hearing people pining for it. Really, you want webpages that crash your entire computer? You want huge internet bills for using too much bandwidth? You want absolutely zero moderation, anywhere, for anything? You want to lose your password and be locked out of a site permanently because there was no “forgot password” links? Of course not. It’s just that people in their 70s want to feel the way they felt when they first heard Jimi Hendrix, and people in their 40s want to feel the way they felt when they first heard Smells Like Teen Spirit. And internet people can feel the way they did on AOL chatrooms again. They just have to choose to look, and stop comparing everything to when they were teenagers. That’s all.

As I write this essay, I want to choose some tangible examples. I’ve stated my premise, stated my case, and now would be a great time for me to show some proof, right? I can tell you about the new protocol I found this morning, or the community I fell in love with a few days ago. I could use vibrant examples to inspire you to go exploring and find the joy I’ve found.

But I think that would be stepping on my own point. It’s not about being pointed directly to new things for you to open in a background tab and never truly look at. It’s about the act of discovery itself. So I’ll just say that the internet has never been better, more expressive, more creative, or more fun. If you disagree with that, you just need to remember to look. It’s out there. Come join us.
