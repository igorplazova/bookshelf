## 10-Vacation Brain

On a vacation I’m pretty sure I’ll read that old book on botany  
From 1956, in a California beach town, from an abandoned library  
Left outside next to a sign that says free  

Traveling back on endless flights I itch to get home  
And distantly imagine I’ll live a simpler life upon re-entry  
More time to read, less time feeling scattered  
Catching up with friends  

Everything seems possible stuck in amber above the clouds  
Who will I be when I land? Will I be this calm?  
Will I nibble from different hobbies and interests like I have this trip?  
But I know I won’t  

I know I’m drifting along a river  
Languid and slow  
But the rapids are waiting for me up ahead  
So away I go
