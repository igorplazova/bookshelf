## 08-Write Before the Plane

I don’t actually think my flight will go down in flames, but right before I travel I feel chapters ending and beginning. This is the last day I’ll be in America for some time. Maybe we’ll come back in a few months, but maybe not. And regardless of when I return again, the trip is drawing to a close, which makes me feel introspective.

It was a fantastic trip. I got to meet with my coworkers, we had a great time, we had lots of good chats, we had lots of fun. It was purely wonderful and good. I’m feeling a few malfunctions here and there — “did I say the right thing that one time?” or “is so-and-so upset with me?” — but those are to be expected when you’re tired and you’ve packed a lot of living into a small space. It will take time for things to settle.

I really enjoyed myself. And now the trip back should be easy. Yes, the flight is long. But it gives me a chance to watch a bunch of television and listen to a bunch of podcasts and stuff. And then, after a few days with my family, I’ll think back at how glorious it was to be running solo for a few days. I miss my family now, and I’ll miss my untethered trip once I’m not in the midst of it anymore.

Onward!
